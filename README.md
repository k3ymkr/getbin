This script just takes in a file and makes a binary file from it based on the capitalization.  I suppose it's a decent way to encode a binary....probably not.

I mostly did it for the PN18 code.  It didn't get me anywhere though.  After rulling out binary encoded ascii, I thought it might be a binary file.  If it is, I don't know what it is.

I thought the code might be useful for another project someday.
